Atryum: A Thermodynamic–Relativistic Framework of Structure and Change Beyond the Illusion of Time

Overview

Atryum is a fundamental framework that redefines our understanding of time, structure, and change.
It demonstrates that time is not an independent entity, but rather a human label for the work of energy — the unfolding of change.

Core Principles

Time does not exist independently — without change, time has no meaning.

Change is the true reality — all transformations in the universe are driven by energy.

Atryum describes a pre-existing structure through which change unfolds.

Rejects the concept of time as a fourth dimension; instead, it proposes structure without size, change without flow, and reality without time.
